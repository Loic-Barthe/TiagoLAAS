Here is the repository dedicated to properly launching the TIAGO robot simulation. This repository contains all the necessary files to simulate the behavior of TIAGO, a mobile robot with a wheeled base. The simulation process relies on various repositories provided here, each containing specific configurations 
and assets required for the simulation to work seamlessly. The repositories are named from 1 to 7, and they need to be placed in the src directory of your ROS (Robot Operating System) workspace. 
Once these files are correctly positioned, you will be able to simulate TIAGO's movements.

# Installation
The first thing to do is to create a worskapce : 

cd ~/TIAGO_perso
mkdir ~/TIAGO_perso/src
cd ~/TIAGO_perso/src
git clone https://github.com/Loic-Barthe/TiagoLAAS.git
cd ~/TIAGO_perso
rosdep install --from-paths src

Then, it is necessary to place all packages in the src of your worspace. The src directory should be organized as follows, as shown in the picture bellow.

workspace/
└── src/
    ├── cpcc2_tiago/
    ├── crocoddyl/
    ├── launch_pal/
    ├── .../
    ├── .../
    ├── .../
    └── urdf_test/

Unzip the repos_x files and place them into an already existing workspace. To create a workspace 

There are also two missing packages, as shown in the previous image: Pinocchio and Crocoddyl. These two packages are essential for the simulation and can be installed either in debug mode, 
allowing you to use tools like GDB for debugging, or through ROBOTPKG.

However, if you choose to install the packages via ROBOTPKG, you'll need to adjust your environment variables accordingly. The necessary changes are outlined in detail in my report.
Please ensure that these environment variables are correctly set to guarantee that the simulation runs smoothly and the packages are properly linked.

# Build

After cloning the repository into the src folder of the workspace and navigating to the root of the workspace, run the following command to build the cpcc2_tiago package:

colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args ' -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE'

You can also run the following command to use only one processor at a time, which will be less resource-intensive for your computer:

MAKEFLAGS="-j 1" colcon build --packages-select <name_of_the_package> --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug 


And then, after building, it is necessary to source the environement by using the command :

. ~/TIAGO_perso/install/setup.bash


# Launching the simulation

To launch the simulation, open terminator and click on Ctrl + e to split the windows into to half. On one, run the command : 

ros2 launch tiago_gazebo tiago_gazebo.launch.py is_public_sim:=True

And on the othern run 

ros2 launch cpcc2_tiago cpcc2_tiago.launch.py
